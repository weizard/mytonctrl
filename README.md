## What is it

This console program is a wrapper over `fift`,`lite-client` and `validator-engine-console`. It was created to facilitate the management of wallets, domains and a validator on the Linux operating system.

## Description of installation scripts

- `toninstaller.sh` - This script clones the sources of `TON` and` mytonctrl` in the folders `/usr/src/ton` and`/usr/src/mytonctrl`, compiles programs from sources and writes them to `/usr/bin/`.
- `mytoninstaller.py` - This script configures the validator, `mytonctrl` and creates keys for connecting to the validator.

## Installation modes

There are two installation modes: `lite` and` full`. They both **compile** and install the `TON` components. However, the `lite` version does not configure or run the validator.

## Installation (Ubuntu)

1. Download and execute the script `install.sh` with the desired installation mode. During installation, you will be prompted for the superuser password several times.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weizard/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh -m <mode>
```

2. Done. You can try to run the program `mytonctrl`.

```sh
mytonctrl
```

## Installation (Debian)
